# smock

Built with [well](https://github.com/anthropics/well) — full-stack OCaml web framework.

## Getting started

```bash
make dev          # start dev server with hot reload (dune exec -w)
make build        # build
make test         # run tests
make check        # type-check only (faster)
```

The dev server runs at **http://localhost:4000**.

`make dev` uses `dune exec -w` which watches for file changes, rebuilds, and restarts the server automatically.

## File types

- `.ml` — OCaml (logic, models, queries)
- `.mlx` — OCaml + JSX (views, components)
- `.ts` — TypeScript (compiled to JS via bun, wired through dune)
